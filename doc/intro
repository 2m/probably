_Probably_ is a testing library designed to unintrusively provide test recording and reporting capabilities to any
codebase, regardless of the users´ choices of libraries or programming paradigms. _Probably_ can define and run
unit tests and property tests. Its syntax is simple and unexciting, and its execution model has zero magic:
it´s the same as for any other program.
